Luxe Essentials - Generated site
===============================

This project was created by the PowerShell generator script.

Folder layout:
- index.html            (homepage)
- shop.html             (shop and subcategories)
- contact.html, about.html, faq.html, orders.html, login.html
- checkout.html, success.html, cancel.html
- css/style.css, css/carousel.css
- js/script.js
- api/create-checkout-session.js (Vercel serverless example)
- images/* (downloaded from Unsplash)

Next steps:
1) Replace Stripe publishable key in js/script.js:
   - find 'pk_test_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY' and replace with your key
2) In Vercel, set environment variables:
   - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = your secret key
   - SITE_URL = https://your-production-domain.com
3) Deploy to Vercel (connect to GitHub repo)
4) Replace placeholder images with your own product photos as needed.

Notes on images:
- Images were downloaded from Unsplash via source.unsplash.com queries.
- If some images failed to download, the generator produced simple placeholders.

- Unsplash images are free to use but please follow Unsplash terms & attribution guidelines if needed.

Enjoy! 🎉
